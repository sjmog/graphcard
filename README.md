# Graphcard

Having another go at a connected flashcard thing.

## Getting Started

- Install Postgres.
- Clone the repo.
- `bundle`.
- `rake db:setup` (you'll get my flashcards too)
- `rails s`

## Roadmap

- Daily SMS reminders.
- Add card via SMS (Q and A delimeters).
- Learning graph (related to...).
- Calendar integration (remember this for...) with intelligent spaced repetition.
- Quotes prompt.
- Per-user tracking of actual box times, and adjustment of their spacing.
